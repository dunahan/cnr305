This system was created by Festyx & Hrnac. Also it has the fix for the Mineral Bath Bug by Axe Murderer contained.
I created this repository to preserve the code on github too. Also to contribute some of my experiances by using it on my persistant world.
This repository contains the version 3.05 in English, with the fix from Axe Murderer added. So this is the very basic version which can  be found on https://neverwintervault.org/project/nwn1/script/craftable-natural-resources-cnr

The different add-ons, like Underdark Biosphere or Infusing (Wand creation), weren't added. Those can be found on the neverwinter vault and installed separately.
